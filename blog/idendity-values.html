        <h3>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
        <p>A number of years ago I attended a youth social group similar to Scouts. We were put into groups of similar aged boys.
          The other boys in my group were all rather unruly, and encouraged each other to disrupt our activities, and to generally
          be a pain to the adult who was leading our group. I didn't like what they were doing, because it was exasperating our leader, 
          and so I refused to join in with them. They were surprised and rather annoyed that I wouldn't do what 
          they were doing, and were hostile towards me for quite a long time afterwards. I beleive I made the right decision to avoid their
          negative peer pressure.
