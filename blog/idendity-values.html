    <h3>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved
      in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now:</h3>
    <p>A number of years ago I attended a youth social group similar to Scouts. We were put into groups of similar aged
      boys.
      The other boys in my group were all rather unruly, and encouraged each other to disrupt our activities, and to
      generally
      be a pain to the adult who was leading our group. I didn't like what they were doing, because it was exasperating
      our leader,
      and so I refused to join in with them. They were surprised and rather annoyed that I wouldn't do what
      they were doing, and were hostile towards me for quite a long time afterwards. I believe I made the right decision
      to avoid their
      negative peer pressure.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity:</h3>
    <p>My family and extended family have a great sense of humor, which has definitely worn off onto me! Growing up in a
      Christian community has shown me the value of honestyand remaining true to what you beleive in. </p>
    <h3>3. Identify your strengths and how they will help you on your learning journey:</h3>
    <p>I really enjoy learning and trying out new things, especially when they challenge me and grow my skills, and I
      have the perseverence to push myself, and to not give up when I'm encountering problems. The sense of satisfaction
      when I solve something I've been struggling with for a while is really rewarding! I'm also willing to test out and
      explore new ways of doing things, and seeing how things work and react in different ways.</p>
    <h3>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your
      learning journey?</h3>
    <p>I have no connections / lack of experience working with others.</p>
    <h3>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or
      tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
    <p>Being homeschooled, I have had very little opportunity to work with other people, so I haven't had any situations
      like this. I am good at teaching myself and being an independant learner as a result, but this is also a definite
      weakness</p>
