    <h3>What is neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>Neuroplasticity is the idea that our brains do not have a fixed intelligence or limit to knowledge, but rather
      that they grow and change every day, in response to our experiences. Our brains are made up of millions of
      neurons, each linked to many others, and when we do an activity for the first time, it creates a set of neurons
      connected to that activity. Each time we repeat the same activity, the connections between the associated neurons
      becomes stronger, because more signals are going through it. Think of it like a road, which doesn't get much use.
      It'll probably only be two lanes, one each way. But if more cars start using the road, it'll have to be improved,
      and more lanes added. </p>
