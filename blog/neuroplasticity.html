    <h3>What is neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>Neuroplasticity is the idea that our brains do not have a fixed intelligence or limit to knowledge, but rather
      that they grow and change every day, in response to our experiences. Our brains are made up of millions of
      neurons, each linked to many others, and when we do an activity for the first time, it creates a set of neurons
      connected to that activity. Each time we repeat the same activity, the connections between the associated neurons
      becomes stronger, because more signals are using it. The more a connection is used, the easier and faster the
      brain will use it next time. Think of it like a road, which doesn't get much use.
      It'll probably only be two lanes, one each way. But if more cars start using the road, it'll have to be improved,
      and more lanes added. When sets of neurons fire at the same time, pathways are made between them, even if they are
      not necessarily from similar activities. You experience this if you play certain music a lot while doing an
      activity, if you hear the music, you will automatically associate it with the activity, and vice versa. </p>
    <p>Someone with a growth mindset learns and does new activities knowing that even if they struggle, they can and
      will improve, and they will be open to tackling difficult problems. Someone with a fixed mindset will still learn
      things, but if they come across a problem or challenge more difficult than what they are used to, they will be put
      off, and may ignore the problem, or in some cases even cheat.</p>
