          <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>My goal is to be a proficient software developer with valuable skills for my workplace.</p>
          <h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
          <p>I am very good at problem solving, and have the perseverance to work on difficult problems without giving up. I also have pretty good communication skills. Some things I need work on would be patience and understanding with other people, especially when difficulties arise.</p>
          <h3> 3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>I would definitely like to see an improvement in my collaboration and understanding of others, because I feel like these are very important things, especially in a work environment where you spend a lot of time working with others.</p>
          <h3>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3>
          <p>I will follow my shedule and try to stick to the timebox recommendations. I will work consistently and avoid distractions.</p>
          <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>If I am stuck on a problem, I'll try to work it out for a while myself, starting by checking my work for typos or similar mistakes, and then looking it up online, and if I'm still stuck after around 15/20 minutes or so, I'll reach out on Discord and see if anyone can help.</p>
          <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p>I expect the Faciliators to help guide me through my learning, and to encourage and help me when I'm having difficulty.</p>
          <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
          <p>I'm busy on Sundays, and Monday evenings. I also work part-time for my father, but this is flexible and can be scheduled around my coursework.</p>
