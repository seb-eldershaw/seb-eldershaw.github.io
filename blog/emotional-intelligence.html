          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence is our ability to understand and manage our emotions and relationships, and to understand those of people around us. It is a learnable skill, rather than an innate ability we're born with although some people do have a naturally higher EQ than others.</p>
