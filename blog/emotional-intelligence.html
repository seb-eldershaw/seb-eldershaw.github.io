          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence is our ability to understand and manage our emotions and relationships, and to understand those of people around us. It is a learnable skill, rather than an innate ability we're born with although some people do have a naturally higher EQ than others.</p>
          <h3>How is EQ different from IQ?</h3>
          <p>IQ is a measure of your intelligence, and how well you can think logically, and solve problems, or retain knowledge. EQ is a measure of how well you can handle your emotions and behaviors. IQ is more unchangeable than EQ, in that once you have reached a certain age, you IQ stops increasing, whereas EQ is a skillset, and you can definitely improve it, even if you don't have a naturally high EQ.</p>
          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
          <p>Being able to understand our emotions, and what causes them is beneficial to us, because we can learn to recognize situations where we behave impulsively, and then manage them accordinly. In a social or relationship context, we can use EQ to understand how other people are feeling, how they make us feel, and how we can relate to them emotionally. People with a higher EQ can increase the time between a stimulus, and their response, giving them time to think through how they should act.</p>
