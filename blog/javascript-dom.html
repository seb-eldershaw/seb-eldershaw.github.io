    <h3 class="center">- JavaScript and the DOM -</h3>
    <h4 class="center"> - JavaScript -</h4>
    <p>While HTML is the main building blocks of a webpage, and CSS is the styling, JavaScript is the functionality of a
      webpage. HTML is like a builder, who makes the structure of a house, CSS is the painter and decorator, who puts
      pretty colours on the walls, and JavaScript is like the plumber, or electrician, who makes the pipes and switches
      actually do things. Using JavaScript, we can make changes to a webpage as the user interacts with it, or play
      animations, and other interactive features. These changes are made in the DOM. </p>
    <h4>What is the DOM?</h4>
    <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model, and is a representation of the HTML that makes up a webpage. What makes the
      DOM special is that it allows the webpage to be modified using JavaScript. Without the DOM, JavaScript has no idea
      about webpages, elements, or styles. A browser uses JavaScript to make changes to an existing webpage, and the DOM
      is the part that shows those changes, which is why the DOM often looks different to the original HTML used to make
      the webpage. For example, you could have an empty paragraph element, which you want to change, depending on
      whether or not the user has submitted a form. In the .html file, you would create the paragraph element, like
      this: </p>

    <code>
      &lt;p id=&quot;formStatus&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    </code>
    <p>Then in the .js file, you need to be able to access that particular paragraph element, so you use this line of
      code: </p>
    <code>
      document.getElementByID(&#39;formStatus&#39;)
    </code>
    <p>What this line does is use the .getElementByID() to look through the document object, which is the .html
      page, for an element with the ID of 'formStatus'. Now that we have told JavaScript what element we're looking for,
      we can make whatever changes to it we like. Here, we want to change the text in the &lt;p&gt; tag, which is
      kept in its .innerHTML object. We first get the element from the .html, then go into it's .innerHTML object, and
      then set it to the text we'd like.</p>
    <code>
        document.getElementByID(&#39;formStatus&#39;).innerHTML = &#39;Thank you for submitting the form!&#39;
      </code>
    <p>Now we can link it to a function, so the text only changes if the user submits the form. If we look back at the
      HTML, we can't see the change though, and our &lt;p&gt; tag is stll empty, because JavaScript actually changed the
      DOM, rahter than the HTML. If we look at our file in a browser, we can see the change, because the browser is
      actually displaying the DOM, rather than the HTML.</p>
    <h4 class="center">- Control Flow -</h4>
    <p>Control flow is how the computer reads through the code and runs it. Starting from the top, and working down
      through the file, the computer will look at each line of code, ignoring any comments.</p>
    <code>
      // Comments look like this //
    </code>
    <p>When the computer looks at functions, it will just note them, and carry on, not running them until they are
      called. If the code contains a loop, the computer will run through the loop, go back up to the top of the loop,
      and run it again, and will continue to do so until the condition for the loop to end occurs. It's important to
      note that if there is no end condition for a loop, the computer will be stuck running it forever, and you'll most
      likely crash your browser. It's not the end of the world, but it's still pretty annoying! </p>
    <h4 class="center">- Functions -</h4>
    <p>Functions are reusable sections of code that are first defined, which means that the stuff you want the function
      to do is put inside, and then called to make it run that stuff.
      Functions look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        function functionName(input variables) {
          // code stuff //
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>To actually get your function to do something, you have to 'call' it. Calling a function tells the computer to
      look back through the code to the place where the function was defined, and to run it. Calling a function looks
      like this:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        functionName(some-input)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The name of the function is arbitrary, but it's a good practice to call your functions something that describes
      what they do, so you, or others who are working on the same code, can easily see what is happening. What makes
      functions so useful is if you want to use the same code multiple times, you only need to write it once, and then
      whenever you need to use it, you can just call the function, rather than writing it all out again. <br> Also, if
      at some point you want to make changes, you only have to change the function's definition, rather than going
      through your code and changing all the repeated code. </p>
    <h3 class="center">- Arrays vs. Objects -</h3>
    <p>Arrays and objects are both ways of storing data in JS. Each can contain any number of items, but there are a few
      key differences to be aware of. Arrays
      use square brackets, and are used to storie lists of data where the order of each item is important. Items in
      arrays each have an index value, which starts at 0. Elements in an array can be accessed by using bracket
      notation. This code will access the first item in the array. </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
      let arayName = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      arrayName[0]
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Objects are used to store data items, where each items has a set of attributes, called properties, and are
      unordered. Each item is
      stored as a key-value pair, and has a name, which is the key, and then a number of properties, which are the
      values. If you were making an online shop, you would use an object, with each product the shop sells being an item
      in the object, and the product name is the key, and the price and stock would be the values.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        let products = {
          productOne: {
            price: 5,
            stock: 100
          },

          productTwo: {
            price: 3,
            stock: 100
          }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>To retreive the properties from an item in an object, you can use either dot notation, for example, if we wanted
      to get the price of product one, we would use this line: </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        productOne.price
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Arrays are best used to store a list of ordered items, and objects are best used to store unordered items with
      properties.</p>
