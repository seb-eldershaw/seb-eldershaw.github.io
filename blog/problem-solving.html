    <h3>Problem solving in code</h3>
    <p>A simple problem I was blocked on was a problem where you had to write a function that took in a bunch of
      strings, and capitalise the first letter of each word. What I had forgotten to do was to return the final string,
      so the function was working perfectly fine, but wasn't acutally giving anything out at the end.
      I tried re-writing the function after making sure I was doing the steps correctly, and it still wouldn't work. At
      this point I was feeling frustrated.
      Then I tried going through and logging each step's results to the console. That's when I realised that the
      function had no final output, and all I had needed to do to fix it was to add 'return' to the final line. I felt
      pretty stupid about missing such a simple thing, but it also is a good reminder to check for obvious things you
      may have missed.</p>
    <p>A time where I solved a problem easily was a challenge where you had to write a function that would go through a
      string of text and remove every time the word 'buzz' occured. I first used pseudo-coding to write out what steps I
      would have to take to achieve the result. I then researched the built in methods I could use. I remembered to add
      a return value, and it worked first time.</p>
    <h4>Pseudo-coding</h4>
    <p>I'm pretty confident with pseudo-coding, I certainly find it useful, especially if you find yourself getting
      confused as to which steps you should take, or what you want each section of code or function to do.</p>
    <h4>Trying something</h5>
      <p>I've nearly always done this. If at first you don't suceed, try, try again. Of course, you have to be willing
        to seek help if you really can't figure it out.</p>
      <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
      <p>I haven't really tried doing this</p>
