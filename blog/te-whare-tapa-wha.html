    <h2 class="center">Four dimentions of wellbeing</h2>
    <p>These are my activities for each of the four pillars:</p>
    <h3>- Physical Wellbeing -</h3>
    <p>I do LARPing with my younger brother around the neighborhood. I'm also learning some staff martial arts.</p>
    <h3>- Family Wellbeing -</h3>
    <p>I live at home currently, so I spend a lot of time with my family! I do a lot of things with my brother.</p>
    <h3>- Emotional and Mental Wellbeing -</h3>
    <p>My faith plays big part in this, because my relationship with God gives me emotional stability. 'And the peace of
      God, which surpassed all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
    <h3>- Spiritual Wellbeing -</h3>
    <p>I spend around 10 mins every day reading my Bible and praying. I'm also involved in the activites my church runs.
    </p>
    <h3>- Interconnections to the land and environment</h3>
    <p>I enjoy spending some time at the river, enjoy the peace and calm.</p>
