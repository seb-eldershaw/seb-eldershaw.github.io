    <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>When learning something new, or even doing something I'm somewhat familar with, if I make a really simple
      mistake, I get more annoyed with myself than I should. </p>
    <p>I also found that I have already developed a growth mindset prior to starting this course, (it was still
      interesting to learn about) and I'm very glad about it; it's an important mindset to have.</p>
    <p>I found the Listening and Looping exercise interesting because I was just focusing on what they were saying,
      without forming opinions.</p>
    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    <p>The role our values have in learning and programming is that they can help us make important decisions. If we
      make the choice that best matches our values, we can avoid being conflicted with ourselves. </p>
    <p>Empathy is important because, when dealing with work coleagues, being able to see where their actions and
      feelings are
      coming from will help you to understand them better, and be enable you to connect with them in a deeper way.</p>
    <p>Self-awareness does a few things. We can use it to see our strengths and weaknesses, or when we need to ask for
      help. We can use self-awareness to observe our emotions, what is triggering them, and recognise bad habits.</p>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>I found it interesting how Human Skills apply or have an impact on nearly every part of our lives.</p>
    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>I've found writing these blog posts particularly difficult, because I tend to overthink what stuff I'm covering,
      and also feel like I'm not getting my point across well, but I do feel like I've improved since my first few!</p>
    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web
      development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>If programming was a completely isolated job, where you were the only person in your workplace, then you wouldn't
      really need to learn HS. However, in the majority of situations, you are part of a team, you spend a lot of time
      working and interacting with others, and having good HS will help you for all the non-technical stuff you
      encounter in the workplace.</p>
    <h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
      that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>No, I think the HS skills we've learnt about will been useful, and have certainly increased my understanding of
      the soft skills I'll be using in my future career. </p>
